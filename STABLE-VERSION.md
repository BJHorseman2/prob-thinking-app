### Commit Information
- **Tag**: v1.0-stable-working
- **Branch**: stable-working-backup  
- **Commit**: 81b8032 - "Fix React hydration issue with ClientOnly wrapper and proper SSR handling"
- **Date**: 2025-07-03

### Development Notes
This version was confirmed working after resolving a critical React hydration issue where buttons were rendering as static HTML without onClick handlers. The fix involved proper SSR/CSR separation and client-side rendering guards.

**IMPORTANT**: Always test button interactivity on localhost:3001 after any changes to ensure React event handlers are properly attached.
