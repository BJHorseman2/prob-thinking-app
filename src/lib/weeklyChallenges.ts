    question: 'A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?',
    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 5,
    explanation: 'Your System 1 (fast thinking) screams "10 cents!" But that\'s wrong. If the ball costs 10¬¢ and the bat costs $1 more (110¬¢), the total would be 120¬¢. The ball actually costs 5¬¢. This is from Kahneman\'s "Thinking, Fast and Slow" - our intuitive mind often gives us the wrong answer.',

    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 100,
    explanation: 'Most people demand $150+ to sell something they just got for free! This is Thaler\'s "endowment effect" - we overvalue things simply because we own them. Rational? No. Human? Absolutely.',

    timeToComplete: '2 min',
    points: 80,
    question: 'A CEO decides to launch a risky new product with a 30% chance of success but huge upside. It fails spectacularly. The board fires him. Was this the right decision?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Fire him - the product failed', 'Keep him - it was a good bet'],
    correctAnswer: 'Keep him - it was a good bet',
    explanation: 'Annie Duke calls this "resulting" - judging decisions by outcomes instead of process. The CEO made a GOOD decision with the information available: a 30% chance of huge upside is often worth taking! Yes, it failed, but that was expected 70% of the time. Firing him punishes good decision-making just because of an unlucky outcome. This bias destroys rational thinking in business, poker, and life.',

    question: 'Which kills more people in the US each year: shark attacks or falling airplane parts?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Shark attacks', 'Falling airplane parts'],
    correctAnswer: 'Falling airplane parts',
    explanation: 'Falling airplane parts kill ~25 people/year, sharks kill ~1. But shark attacks get massive media coverage! Kahneman showed we judge probability by how easily examples come to mind. The news makes rare dramatic events feel common.'

    question: 'The population of Turkey is 84 million. What\'s your estimate for the population of Canada?',
    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 38,
    explanation: 'Most people guess 60-80 million, anchored by Turkey\'s 84 million. But Canada has only 38 million people! This is anchoring bias - the first number you hear heavily influences your estimate, even when it\'s irrelevant.',

    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Linda is a bank teller', 'Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement'],
    correctAnswer: 'Linda is a bank teller',
    explanation: 'Most choose option 2, but that\'s mathematically impossible! The probability of A AND B can never exceed the probability of A alone. Our brain creates a compelling story that overrides basic logic.'

    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Go skiing - you paid $100!', 'Skip skiing - stay safe and have fun locally'],
    correctAnswer: 'Skip skiing - stay safe and have fun locally',
    explanation: 'The $100 is gone whether you ski or not - it\'s a sunk cost! Risking your safety because you already paid is irrational. Yet most people can\'t ignore sunk costs, leading to bad decisions in investing, relationships, and projects.'

    question: 'A test for a rare disease (affects 1 in 1000) is 99% accurate. You test positive. What\'s the probability you actually have the disease?',
    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 9,
    explanation: 'Only about 9%! Most guess 99%, ignoring the base rate. With 1000 people: 1 has the disease (tests positive), 999 don\'t (but ~10 test false positive). So only 1 of 11 positive tests are real. Always consider base rates!'

    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Program A - Save 200 for sure', 'Program B - 1/3 chance to save all'],
    correctAnswer: 'Program A - Save 200 for sure',
    explanation: 'Most choose A when framed as "saves lives" but B when framed as "400 will die" vs "1/3 chance none die". Same math, different frame! Thaler showed how framing manipulates our choices.'

    question: 'You\'re buying a $125 jacket and $15 calculator. The clerk says the calculator is $5 cheaper at another store 20 minutes away. Do you go?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Yes - save $5', 'No - not worth 20 minutes'],
    correctAnswer: 'Yes - save $5',
    explanation: 'Most say yes for the calculator but no if the jacket is $5 off! Yet it\'s the same $5 and 20 minutes. Thaler\'s mental accounting shows we irrationally categorize money instead of viewing it fungibly.'

    question: 'What percentage of US adults have a passport? Give your 90% confidence interval (range you\'re 90% sure contains the true answer).',
    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 42,
    explanation: 'It\'s 42%. Most people give ranges like 60-80% or 20-40%, far too narrow! We\'re systematically overconfident in our knowledge. Good calibration means your 90% intervals should contain the truth 90% of the time.'

    question: 'A team estimates their project will take 4 months. Based on similar past projects taking 6-10 months, what\'s your best guess for completion time?',
    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 8,
    explanation: 'History suggests 8 months, but teams ignore base rates! Kahneman found we focus on best-case scenarios and ignore past data. This is why construction, software, and homework always take longer than planned.'

    timeToComplete: '2 min',

    question: 'You just lost a huge pot with pocket aces to a river suck-out. You\'re steaming. The very next hand you get pocket kings. What\'s the optimal play?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Play aggressively to win back the money', 'Play your normal strategy - ignore the last hand', 'Fold and take a 5-minute break', 'Bet bigger to intimidate opponents'],
    correctAnswer: 'Play your normal strategy - ignore the last hand',
    explanation: 'Going on "tilt" after bad beats destroys more bankrolls than bad cards. Each hand is independent - your kings are just as strong whether you won or lost the last hand. Emotional control separates winning players from fish.'

    question: 'You have a flush draw (9 outs) on the turn. Pot is $100, opponent bets $50. You need to call $50 to win $150. Pot odds: 3:1. Your odds: 4:1. But you have a "feeling" opponent is bluffing. What do you do?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Call - the pot odds are close enough', 'Fold - you\'re not getting proper odds', 'Raise - trust your read', 'Call - always trust your gut'],
    correctAnswer: 'Fold - you\'re not getting proper odds',
    explanation: 'Math doesn\'t care about feelings! You need 3:1 odds but only getting 4:1. Even if you "feel" they\'re bluffing, you\'re making a -EV call. Winning poker players trust math over emotions.'

    question: 'You have a $2,000 poker bankroll. A juicy $5/$10 cash game is running, but it\'s above your normal $1/$2 stakes. The game looks soft. What\'s the smart move?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Jump in - the game is too good to miss', 'Stay at $1/$2 - stick to your bankroll rules', 'Play $5/$10 but with a shorter session', 'Risk half your bankroll on this great opportunity'],
    correctAnswer: 'Stay at $1/$2 - stick to your bankroll rules',
    explanation: 'Bankroll management is the difference between pros and broke players. $2k isn\'t enough for $5/$10 (need 40+ buy-ins). "Soft" games become less profitable when you\'re scared money. Discipline > opportunity.'

    timeToComplete: '3 min',
    points: 95,
    question: 'You\'re a winning player (3bb/100 winrate). After 10,000 hands, you\'re down $2,000. Your friend says "maybe you\'re not as good as you think." What\'s the truth?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['He\'s right - good players don\'t have losing streaks', 'This is normal variance - keep playing your A-game', 'Take a break to analyze your game', 'Move down stakes until you\'re winning again'],
    correctAnswer: 'This is normal variance - keep playing your A-game',
    explanation: 'Poker variance is brutal! Even winning players can lose for 10K+ hands. With 3bb/100 winrate, you still have 30% chance of losing after 10K hands. Most players quit during normal downswings, not understanding math.'

    question: 'You have 16, dealer shows 10. Basic strategy says hit, but you\'ve busted the last 3 times with 16. The other players are telling you to "stand - never bust." What do you do?',
    type: 'choice',
    options: ['Stand - avoid the bust', 'Hit - follow basic strategy', 'Split the difference and sometimes hit', 'Ask the dealer what they would do'],
    correctAnswer: 'Hit - follow basic strategy',
    explanation: 'Basic strategy is mathematically optimal over millions of hands. Your recent bust streak is irrelevant - each hand is independent. Standing on 16 vs 10 loses 54% of the time, hitting loses 52%. Math doesn\'t care about your feelings.'

    question: 'At roulette, red has come up 7 times in a row. A player next to you says "black is due!" and bets $500 on black. What\'s the probability the next spin is black?',
    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 47,
    explanation: 'Still 47.4%! The wheel has no memory. Each spin is independent. "Due" is a cognitive illusion. Red could easily hit 10+ times in a row. The gambler\'s fallacy destroys more bankrolls than bad luck.'

    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: -5,
    explanation: 'You lose $5.26 per spin on average! Red wins 18/38 times (47.4%), loses 20/38 times (52.6%). EV = (18/38 √ó $100) - (20/38 √ó $100) = -$5.26. The house edge grinds everyone down over time.'

    type: 'estimate',
    correctAnswer: 25,
    explanation: 'About 25% risk of ruin! Even with an edge, variance is brutal. You need 200+ bets in your bankroll to survive the swings. Plus casinos ban counters. Risk of arrest, backoff, and lost time makes it barely profitable for most.'

    options: ['Missing out on bigger gains', 'Increasing position sizes due to overconfidence', 'Not taking profits soon enough', 'Other traders copying your strategy'],
    correctAnswer: 'Increasing position sizes due to overconfidence',

    options: ['Sell Stock A - lock in the gain', 'Sell Stock B - cut your losses', 'Hold both and find cash elsewhere', 'Sell whichever has worse future prospects'],
    correctAnswer: 'Sell whichever has worse future prospects',

    correctAnswer: 'You\'re experiencing a lucky streak',
